## üèÅ Introduction

This project invites you to to plan and reference the final presentation that
you will give for the exposition engineering course. The final presentations
will take place on **Friday, May 3, 2024 from 9 AM until 12 noon**. You must
complete all aspects of this project by **Thursday, May 2, 2024 at 11:59 PM** so
as to allow time for the course instructor to review your work and setup the
presentation computer in the front of our classroom. To be clear, students who
have not completed the content in the `presentation.md` file by the deadline and
provided a link to their presentation in Google Slides will not be permitted to
give the final presentation. Finally, students will be randomly chosen to give
their presentation during the three-hour time block allocated for final
examination.

Please note that the content provided in the `README.md` file for this GitHub
repository is an overview of the project and thus may not include the details
for every step needed to successfully complete every project deliverable. This
means that you may need to schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours to discuss aspects of this project. Finally, it is important to
point out that your repository for this project was created from the GitHub
repository template called
[exposition-engineering-podcast-presentation-starter](https://github.com/ExpositionEngineering/exposition-engineering-podcast-presentation-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation or
source code!

## ü§ù Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an exposition engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical writing content found in additional resources.

## üõ´ Project Overview

This assignment invites you to create a show outline for a podcast on the topic
of picking an academic major at an institution like Allegheny College. You must
read all of the `TODO` markers inside of the `presentation.md` file
and write the content and take the steps that they require. Once you are
finished with your description of the podcast presentation you should use
Google Slides to create your presentation, make sure that the presentation is
(at minimum) shared to everyone at Allegheny College, and then provide the link
to your presentation in Google Slides inside of the `presentation.md` file.

Here are the approved topics for the podcast presentation:

- The future of the podcasting industry
- The way(s) in which artificial intelligence will influence podcasting
- How the growth mindset can help you to create a successful podcast
- The role that software tools (e.g., VS Code and GitHub) play in effective
communication, including the creation and sharing of podcasts
- Student designed topic that must be pre-approved by the course instructor

**Please note that your presentation must contain a reference to at least one
reputable source that supports the claim you are making during your talk.**

## üêä Project Assessment

Please keep in mind the following reminders as you consider how the course
instructor will assess the final version of your project:

- If you have already installed the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
Please note that if all of the GatorGrader checks do not pass, then your GitHub
Actions build will not pass either. You need to make sure that you have a
passing build in GitHub Actions before the project's due date.
- The GitHub repository that houses this project has a GitHub Actions
configuration that will report to you through the GitHub Actions tab a summary
of the key results from running the assessment. You can check this tab to
quickly see which the status of the GatorGrader checks and to review a report
about the coverage of the test suite that accompanies the project.
- Don't forget that you must provide all of the required responses to the
technical writing prompts in the
`writing/presentation.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
labels from all of the provided source code and technical writing. This means
that instead of only deleting and/or rewriting the `TODO` marker from the file
you should delete the `TODO` marker and the entire prompt and then add your own
content to demonstrate that you understand all aspects of this project.
- Please remember that passing the baseline checks that are run through the
GatorGrader tool is not a guarantee that you will earn the highest possible
grade on this assignment. This is due to the fact that the course instructor
will also check, for instance, the quality of your writing and confirm, for
instance, the absence of any spelling or grammar mistakes.
